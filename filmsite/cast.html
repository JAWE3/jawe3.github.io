                    <p>Brian was created by screenwriter Gary Scott Thompson, who was inspired by an article on street racing that was published in the May 1998 issue of Vibe magazine. Walker was directly approached by director Rob Cohen to play the character.</p>

                        after and raised her following their father's death. Dominic's friend, Vince, is shown to be attracted to her.</p>
                    <p>Mia is also shown to be a proficient driver as she also grew up with Dominic under their race car driver father. In Fast &amp; Furious, Mia is under surveillance by the FBI.</p>

                    <p>In The Fast and the Furious, Letty expresses some concern about Dominic's carjacking scheme, but goes along to back him up despite her concerns. In the end, during a botched highway robbery, she rolls her car and is injured, but survives.</p>
                    <p>During the events of Fast &amp; Furious, she is on Dominic's crew in his heists of fuel tankers in the Dominican Republic, but when the local law enforcement starts closing in, he leaves her behind to protect her from harm.</p>

                    <p>Vince is a childhood friend and street racer under Dominic Toretto. He opposed O'Conner's inclusion into Dominic's crew especially since his sister favored O'Conner over him. During Race Wars, Johnny Tran blames Dominic for the SWAT
                        forces that came into his house, disrespecting his whole family for being narced out by someone and they get into a fight.</p>
                    <p>Vince then leads Dominic away telling him to chill out. Near the end of the first film, Vince is seriously injured when he is shot by a trucker whose shipments he attempted to hijack. He recovers from his injuries, escapes from the
                        hospital, and goes to Rio de Janeiro.</p>
                    <div class="xtra-txt">
                        <p>He is not present or mentioned in Fast &amp; Furious, but can be seen in a picture with Letty and Dominic at Letty's funeral, although his face is not clear. Vince re-appears in Fast Five living in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro
                            with his wife, Rosa and infant son, Nico (who is named after Dominic).

                    <p>Jesse is a street racer and the brains of Dominic's operations, and he is a wheelman in the heists. Jesse admits to having ADD and is shown often stuttering in his speeches and acting very nervous.
                    </p>
                    <p>Despite this setback, he is the computer nerd of the group as he is responsible for creating the designs, doing background checks on people, and hacking the engine characteristics of Toretto's race vehicles with precise calculations
                        (a potential characteristic of those with ADD as they may at times have high IQs).</p>
                    <div class="xtra-txt">
                        <p>However, he is somewhat irresponsible, a fact which was evident when he raced Johnny Tran for pink slips against the wishes of both Brian and Toretto who warned him that Tran had over $100,000 under the hood of his vehicle.</p>
                        <p> This proved to be true as Jesse lost to Tran, later driving off and escaping his loss. An enraged Tran and an accomplice later pull a drive-by shooting at Toretto's house missing everyone but Jesse, who gets hit, killing him instantly.
                            Brian and Dominic chase after Tran, shooting him dead and avenging Jesse's death.</p>
