                <h1>Majors</h1>
                <div class="content">
                    <div>
                        <p>When we announced the Rio Major, we were excited to bring a CS:GO Major to one of
                            Counter-Strike’s most passionate fan bases. At the time, we couldn’t have imagined the
                            global
                            challenges that have limited live events throughout 2020.</p>
                        <p>We’re not going to ask players and fans to risk their health in order to attend a Major while
                            the
                            pandemic still poses a threat to travelers. Therefore, we have made the painful decision to
                            cancel the November Major.</p>
                        <p>So, what’s the plan? First, we’re going to hold off on scheduling Majors until, at a minimum,
                            Regional Major Ranking (RMR) LAN events are safe to hold around the world. Until then, we
                            expect
                            to continue to hold online RMR events to keep track of the best teams in each region.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Recently we’ve been made aware that several coaches of professional CS:GO teams exploited a
                            bug
                            in the game in order to gain an advantage over their opponents.</p>
                        <p>It is unfortunate and frustrating that we did not respond to this bug sooner. But bugs are
                            the
                            reality of software—and until they are resolved, we need to be able to trust players and
                            coaches.We won’t spend much time here reiterating our stance on the importance of integrity
                            in
                            CS:GO matches. </p>
                        <p>At a minimum, we expect that players and coaches will play by the rules, and immediately
                            pause
                            the match and alert tournament admins if they know of an issue that may give them (or an
                            opponent) an unfair advantage.</p>
                        <p>We’re looking forward to getting LAN events started again, and hope that we can all find a
                            safe
                            way to do it soon.</p>
